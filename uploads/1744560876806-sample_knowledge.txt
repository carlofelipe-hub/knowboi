Getting Started with KnowBoi
KnowBoi is a knowledge base assistant that helps you search through uploaded documents using semantic search. Upload your .txt files and ask questions to get accurate answers powered by OpenAI.

Admin Access
Only users with admin privileges can access the admin dashboard. From there, you can manage users, delete documents, and monitor usage.

Supported File Types
Currently, KnowBoi only supports plain text files (.txt). Support for PDF and DOCX may be added in the future.

Data Privacy
Your uploaded documents are stored securely and can be accessed by any user in the shared workspace. We do not expose files publicly outside of the KnowBoi platform.

Asking a Good Question
To get the best answers, ask clear, specific questions. For example, instead of asking “how?”, try “how do I reset my password using KnowBoi?”.

Token Limits
Each query is processed with a limit on how much text can be considered. This ensures fast responses and prevents overload.

Embedding Details
Each uploaded document is split into chunks and converted into a 1536-dimensional vector using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model.

Employee Onboarding Process
All new employees must complete orientation within the first 5 business days. This includes HR paperwork, security training, and an overview of internal tools like KnowBoi.

Time-Off Requests
Employees must submit vacation requests at least 2 weeks in advance using the internal HR portal. All requests are subject to approval by the department lead.

Incident Escalation Workflow
If an issue cannot be resolved within Tier 1 support, escalate to Tier 2 by creating a JIRA ticket and tagging the responsible team lead. Critical issues must also be reported via Slack #escalations.

Work from Home Policy
Employees are allowed to work remotely up to 3 times per week. All remote work must be logged via the Attendance Tracker app by 9:00 AM.

Data Backup Protocol
All internal documents are backed up to AWS S3 every 24 hours. If you need to restore a file, submit a request through the IT Helpdesk portal.

Monthly Performance Reviews
Managers must schedule 1-on-1 performance reviews by the last Friday of each month. The HR team sends auto-reminders every 20th of the month.

Slack Naming Convention
Usernames in Slack should follow the format: `firstname.lastname`. For example, Carlo Reyes would be `carlo.reyes`. Nicknames and emojis are discouraged in professional channels.
